# Letus / RentMoola Case Study

## Overview and Origin

RentMoola was founded on April 2nd, 2013 by twins Philipp and Patrick Postrehovsky along with their technology advisor, Ajay Hans.  Their mission at the time... to reduce the usage of checks and cash in the Rental industry.  Patrick thought of the idea when he was living in Shanghia and trying to pay his $5,000 monthly rent in cash.  Bank Machines had daily and weekly withdrawal limits, so it was taking him multiple visits to get the cash to pay his rent.  Thus formed the idea to create a company with a better way to pay his rent.

Letus, powered by RentMoola was formed around 2018 - 2019.  Details and the solutions each provide are difficult to determine, as many social media and publication links are broken on the RentMoola site.  Looking up Communications on the Letus site simply takes you back to the RentMoola site, so there is some broken information.  Although many sites says Letus (formerly RentMoola), their Social Media sites say either "Letus by RentMoola" or "Letus".

When RentMoola started, they were funded by bootstrap sources.  As they grew, they went out to source new funding.  According to crunchbase, the company has raised $10M through two venture rounds.  The first in 2016 where they raised $5M with the lead investor being Conservice.  The second was in 2017 where they raised an additional $5M with the lead investor being TriView Capital.

They were also sucessful in a Preferred Share offering in 2019 and generated $3.5M with lead investments from the lead principals of Ayrshire Real Estate Management Inc. (Ayrshire)

## Business Activities

RentMoola started with the simple financial problem of paying rent.  Paying rent is a very traditional environment with most Landlords and Property Managers only allowing Cash or Checks.  RentMoola's mission is to change this environment and make it easy and beneficial to pay rent through other avenues such as Bank Account, Credit Card, PayPal, UnionPay, etc.  

Now Letus, their primary customer are Renters, Landlords and Property Management Companies.  In 2019, the market in Canada represented about 4.5 Million Families paying over $54 Billion in rent anually.

When RentMoola entered the market back in 2013, they had no competition.  They were the first to focus on the Rental Market and the first to put a system in place for both Landlords and Tenants to jointly.  Still today, Letus has very little competition.  They set themselves apart by continuing to offer more products and offering a complete solution for both Renters and Landlords.  They have put together a product that is continually improving, continually partnering with new and existing companies.

A couple primary competitors are:  
*RentPayment*

*ClickPay*

<br><br>
## Landscape

Letus plays primarily in the Paytech domain, focusing on Payments, Billing and Money Transfers.  According to their website, they do offer Consumer Credit and Landlord Working Capital, so may play a bit in the Lendtech domain, but this is not their primary focus.  

The Paytech domain has seen a hugh increase in the last few years, was accelerated by the COVID pandemic.  With people unable to visit stores, online shoping, which includes digital payments, became very popular.  

According to Capgmini's World Payments Report, 2021 non-cash payments rose 17% vs 2020, the highest rise in the last 10 years.  They also forcast that non-cash payments continue to rise at a rate of 16%-17% over the next 5 years.  This will equate to approximately 2 Trillion non-cash transactions per year!  

There are many companies playing in the Paytech domain and this number continues to grow as the sector continues to see adaption rates increase.  The key players in this domain range from traditional companies such as MasterCard and VISA as well as new startups such as Uber and Stripe.

Major trends and some new and traditional competitors in the Paytech domain include:  
* **Open Banking** - Banks will share client's data via secure API's.  This allows consumers to access all thier financial information through a single application. This is not currently available in Canada, but is in many other areas of the world. Major competitors are:
    * Token
    * Salt Edge
    * Tink by VISA
    * Plaid  
<br>
* **Blockchain** - Blockchain verified data is secure which allows protection from fraudsters.  It also enables faster internations transactions.  Major Compeitors are:  
    * HIVE
    * Canaan Inc.
    * Monex Group
    * Mojito  
<br>
* **Embedded Finance** - This enables non-financial organizations to leverage various digital technologies to offer financial solutions to their customers. Major Competitors are:
    * Credify
    * Stitch
    * DriveWealth
    * ApplePay  
<br>
* **Super Apps** - This area brings many products into one App or program.  You can message, schedule an appointment, place an order, shop and make payments, all in the same App! This area is very popular in Asia and the Middle East but has not yet taken hold in North America or Europe.  Major Competitors are:
    * AliPay
    * WeChat  
<br>
* **Voice Payments** - Think Siri or Alexa... Voice technologies are working towards making the customer experience completely hands-free while still maintaining security. Although this is not yet possible, Major Competitors that are on the verge of making this a reality are:
    * Siri
    * Alexa
    * Cortana  
<br>
* **Virtual Cards** - This is becoming one of the most safest ways to pay for goods and services.  Instead of providing a fixed 16-digit number and infomation of a physical bank card, this menthod provides a temporary 16-digit number.  It also provides an quick way to block the card without losing access to the physical card.
    * KOHO
    * Stack
    * Weathsimple
    * American Express Go
<br><br>
## Results
With the introduction of RentMoola, the rental landscape was significantly altered.  It allowed renters the ease of paying how they wanted and allowed them to easily access funds that would not have been easily or efficently accessed before.  The primany advantage to renters being allowed to pay by credit card directly is the removal of the high cash withdrawal fees that credit cards charge for a cash advance.  It also allowed landlords to accept credit card payments, without paying the credit card fees and therefore cutting into their already slim margins.  

As RentMoola and the Letus evolved, they offered many other options to help alter this landscape.  They now offer innovative solutions for both Landlords and Tenants.  These include:
<br>
* Risk Management for Landlords / Property Managers
    * Say goodby to late or missed payments
    * Identify Ideal Tenants - Integrated into thier system is Credit and Background Checks
    * Increased Efficiency with consolidated reports - OneStop reporting for all Rental properties and tenants
    * Increase Revenue Stream - Lowers the number of tenants in arrears as the tenants have more and easier access to money
<br><br>
* Financial Control for Tenants
    * Flexible Payment Solutions - Pay how you want... Credit Card, PayPal, UnionPay, Online or In-Store
    * Customer Friendy Credit Solutions - Interest Free Loans to help pay rent
    * Tools to Improve Credit Scores - Letus sends payment history directly to credit score companies
    * Financial Marketplace for all thier needs:
        * Insurance - Partnered with an Insurance Company to provide and track Insurance policies
        * Utilities - Landlords can include Utility Fees in the program
        * Security Deposit

Letus's success can be seen in the many partnerships that they have created and continue to create.  These partnerships include:
* Property Management Associations:
    * National Apartment Association
    * Canadian Federation of Apartment Association
    * frpo
    * Greater Toronto Apartment Association
    * Eastern Ontario Landlord Organization
* Payment Partners
    * MasterCard
    * VISA
    * American Express
    * Discover
    * BMO
    * PayNearMe
    * Payment Source
    * UnionPay International
* Industry Partners
    * Yardi
    * ResMan
    * mri
    * wyse
    * Conservice
    * Rezedent
    * TrustStamp

As Letus is a private company, further financial statment analysis is not publically available.  Comparisons again thier competitors are also difficult as they really stand on their own by offering the entire package to both Landlords and Tenants.

<br><br>
## Recomendations

As Letus continues to evolve, they should continue to specialize in what they do best.  Some new partners that they should explore as technologies evolve are:
* Pay by voice
* Offering thier own virtual card
* More communication avenues between Landlord and Tenant such as a Texting Service for notifications

Their current communication between Landlords and Tenants is simply a Landlord uploading a document which both parties can see.  By expending this communication avenue to things such as emails and text messages, it would eliminate even more pain points.  This communication could include:
* Access Notifications
* Maintenance Requests
* Move Requests
* Ending Tenancy Requests
* and more...

The Landlord / Tenant relationship is a very complicated and challengine one.  By expanding thier capabilities, they can make this simpler and a better experience for all.
